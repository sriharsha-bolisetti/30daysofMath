#### Introduction and Warm Up
- To simulate physics, you have to know how forces affect objects and cause continous change over time.
- The math of continuous change is called `calculus`, and the laws of physics are usually expressed in terms of objects from calculus called `differential equations`.
- `Turing Complete languages` -> you can (in principle) compute anything that can be computed. 
- Of all the ways that you can make abstractions in programming, the most important one to carry over to math is the `function`.
- Math can be intimidating because it is `abstract`. In any well-written software, the abstraction is introduced for a reason - it helps you organize and communicate bigger and more powerful ideas. When you grasp these ideas and translate them into code, you'll open up some exciting possibilities.
- Different types of functions convey different kinds of qualitative behavior. For instance, an exponential depreciation function means that a car loses a percentage of its resale value with each mile driven rather than a fixed amount.
